MongoDB: is an open-source document database that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling.

Document Database: A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of field and value pairs.
MongoDB docs are similar to JSON objects. The values of fields may include other douments, arrays and array of documents

Advantages of using documents are:
1. Documents correspond to native data types in many programming languages
2. Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins
3. Dynamic schema supports fluent polymorphism

Key Features:
1. High Performance: MongDB provides high performance data persistence. In particular,
  a) support for embedded data models reduces I/O activity on database system.
  b) Indexes support faster queries and can include keys from embedded documents and arrays

2. Rich Query Language: MongoDB supports a rich query language to support CRUD as well as:
  a) Data Aggregation
  b) Text Search and GeoSpatial Queries
  
3. High Availability: Mongo DB's replication facility, called replica set, provides:
  a) automatic failover
  b) data redundancy
  
4. Horizontal Scalability: MongoDB provides horizontal functionality as its core functionality:
  a) Sharding distributes data across a cluster of machines
  b) MongoDB 3.4 supports creating zones of data based on the shard key. In a balanced cluster, MongoDB directs reads and writes covered by a zone only to those shards inside the zone.
  
5. Support for Multiple Storage Engines


MongoDB stores data as BSON documents [binary representation of JSON] in collections. MongoDB hold collection of documents.

Query Documents:
1. Select All Documents
  db.collection('<collection-name>').find({});
2. Match an Embedded Document - this requires an exact match including the order of fields
  db.collection('inventory').find({size: { h: 14, w: 21, uom: "com" } });
3. Match a field in Embedded Document
  db.collection('inventory').find({ "size.uom": "in" });
4. Match an element in an array
  db.collection('inventory').find({ tags: "red" });
5. Match an Array Exactly
  db.collection('inventory').find({ tags: ["red", "blank"] });
  
  


Views: Starting in version 3.4, MongoDB adds support for creating read-only views from existing collections or other views.
Views exhibit the following behavior:
  a. Read Only [i.e., supports find(), findOne(), aggregate(), count(), and distinct() operations]
  b. Index Use and Sort Operations - use the indexes of the underlying collection
  c. Projection Restrictions: find operation on views do not support the $, $elemMatch, $slice, $meta projection operators
  d. Immutable Name
  

Capped Collections: are fixed size collections that support high-throughput operations that insert and retrieve documents based on insertion order. Capped Collections work in a way similar to circular buffers.


Document Size Limit: The maximum BSON document size is 16MB. The maximum document size helps ensure that a single document cannot use excessive amount of RAM or, during transmission, excessive amount of bandwidth.
To store documents larger than the maximum size, MongoDB provides the GridFS API.

BSON Types: BSON is a binary serialization format used to store documents and make remote procedure calls in MongoDB.
